This lab has been implemented in C++ language.


Compile the code by the following command:
    g++ risc_v.cpp

Run the executible by the following command:
    ./a.out

INPUT:
    The input should be given in a file named "input.txt"
    Each instruction should be given in a separate line.

OUTPUT:
    The resulting assembly code in RISC-V is printed in file named "output.txt",
    With each instruction in a separate line .
